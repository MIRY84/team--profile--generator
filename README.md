My task was  to take the given starter code and convert it into a working Node.js command-line application. This application will take in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. You have been provided with tests, so I made sure every part of my code passes each provided test.

## User Story

As a manager a user want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that a user have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

## Instructions

Open the terminal and type node index.js. It will prompts a series of questions to initailize the html file creating the team.
after completing it it will generate dinamically your team profile
1. First I ran all the unit tests to make sure every code was clean and functional
